## 2025-05-18 - Fallback Master Key in TokenManager
**Vulnerability:** In `TokenManager.kt`, if MasterKeys creation fails, it falls back to a hardcoded string `"_fallback_master_key_"`. This is a critical vulnerability because an attacker could extract this key from the app and use it to decrypt the tokens.
**Learning:** Hardcoded cryptographic keys defeat the purpose of encryption, turning it into easily reversible obfuscation.
**Prevention:** Avoid falling back to hardcoded keys. If key generation fails, it should throw an exception to let the caller fallback to explicitly unencrypted shared preferences rather than giving a false sense of security with a hardcoded cryptographic alias.
