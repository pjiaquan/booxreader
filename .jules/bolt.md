## 2025-02-12 - Memory limits on database operations
**Learning:** Room/SQLite has a limit on the number of variables in an IN clause (usually 999). Operating on large lists without chunking will crash with 'Too many SQL variables'.
**Action:** Always use `.chunked(900)` or similar when passing large collections to Room IN queries (e.g. `deleteByIds`, `getByIds`).
